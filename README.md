# BrainTumorClassifier
This was my final project for my computer vision and image processing course. This project preprocess brain MRI images and trains a support vector machine to classify a brain as having a tumor or not. The code randomly selects images to be either training or test data, preprocesses the images, trains the SVM, and finally tests the SVM's efficacy.

The project implements the algorithm proposed by Dr. Parveen and Dr. Singh in their paper "Detection of brain tumor in MRI images, using combination of fuzzy c-means and SVM."

See Documents/README.pdf for more information on how to run the matlab scripts, how each preprocessing and training part works, and comparison of my results with those from the paper.
